Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive review of various biometric authentication mechanisms used in the cloud computing environment. The study focuses on the importance of data security and privacy in cloud computing and the limitations of traditional password-based authentication methods. The paper discusses the different types of authentications, including proof-of-knowledge, proof-of-possession, and proof-of-characteristics. It then explores physical biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint, palm print, iris identification, and behavioural biometric methods such as voice recognition, signature recognition, and typing behaviour. The paper also discusses the registration, login, and verification phases of biometric authentication in cloud computing. The study concludes by highlighting the need for a more robust authentication model and suggests future research directions.

Publication Details: This information is not provided in the PDF file.
Abstract:
This paper discusses the challenges of conducting digital forensics and incident response in cloud computing environments and proposes a new approach to overcome these difficulties. The proposed approach involves using hypervisor-assisted observation to monitor and analyze the behavior of virtual machines in the cloud. The paper presents experimental findings that demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in detecting and analyzing security incidents in cloud systems. The results suggest that hypervisor-assisted forensics can provide a valuable tool for incident response teams in cloud environments.

Title: Cognitive Compliance: Analyze, Monitor and Enforce Compliance in the Cloud
Author(s): Constantin Adam, Muhammed Fatih Bulut, Milton Hernandez, Maja Vukovic
Affiliation: IBM T.J. Watson Research Center, Yorktown Heights NY 10598, USA
Abstract: 
IT compliance is an area of increasing attention and capital spend in enterprise IT environments. Enforcing compliance is a complex process that involves following regulatory requirements and mapping them against a control’s framework. In this paper, the authors propose a solution for streamlining the process of analyzing, monitoring, and enforcing compliance in the cloud. They rely on text classification methodologies to match regulatory requirements and controls against a common hierarchy. The paper also describes a framework for monitoring and enforcing compliance in the cloud infrastructure.

Title: Secure Access Service Edge: A Zero Trust Based Framework For Accessing Data Securely
Author(s): Silafu Yiliyaer, Yoohwan Kim
Affiliation(s): Department of Computer Science, University of Nevada Las Vegas, Las Vegas, NV 89154, USA
Abstract: With the growing demand for remote work, organizations need to provide secure access to their private networks. This paper introduces the Secure Access Service Edge (SASE) framework, which combines various network utility and security functions at the edge of the cloud. SASE uses a Zero Trust Architecture, authenticating and authorizing every request without trusting any device or user. It leverages Software Defined Wide Area Network (SD-WAN) for efficient and encrypted connections, Secure Web Gateway (SWG) for additional security, and Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) to enforce security policies. The paper discusses the deployment and operation of SASE, as well as its benefits and challenges.

Abstract: Electronic data has been created today in large quantities requiring data recovery services organization’s work may experience the various type of disasters whether it was natural or man-made, which may result in huge loss of data. The purpose of recovery technology is the possibility of retrieving information from the backup server when the main data server is lost in the event of disasters. There are some difficulties such as time and cost complexity that make it difficult to implement such techniques. When you use disaster conditions as a service, these disasters can be remedied and data recovery speeds at low cost. In this paper, we compared and discuss the various techniques to create a unique backup and recovery system. In general, all these techniques focus on three different aspects: cost control, data replication, and security issues.
